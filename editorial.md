# Build Your Own Stripe_lite: A Minimal Viable Product

In this tutorial, we will guide you through creating a minimal viable product (MVP) of Stripe_lite, an open-source version of Stripe. We'll be using TypeScript as our primary language and Express (or Fastify) alongside Node.js crypto for creating HTTP endpoints and performing secure hashing and signature verification, respectively.

## Prerequisites

To build Stripe_lite, you need the following requirements:

- Node.js (version >= 14.x)
- npm or Yarn package manager
- Postgres (or MySQL) for our database

## Project Structure

We'll follow this directory structure for our project:

```
Stripe_lite/
|-- server.ts
|-- config.ts
|-- payments/
|   |-- payment_controller.ts
|   |-- payment_service.ts
|-- customers/
|   |-- customer_controller.ts
|   |-- customer_service.ts
|-- subscriptions/
|   |-- subscription_controller.ts
|   |-- subscription_service.ts
|-- webhooks/
|   |-- webhook_controller.ts
|   |-- webhook_service.ts
|-- dashboard/
|   |-- dashboard_routes.ts
|-- utils/
|   |-- logger.ts
|   |-- auth.ts
|-- examples/
|   |-- basic_payments_demo/
|   |   |-- demo_server.ts
|   |   |-- demo_config.ts
|   |   |-- README.md
```

Now, let's get started on building the basic components of our project!

## Step 1: Setting up the Server (`server.ts`)

Our `server.ts` file will be the entry point for our Node.js server and will set up routes and middleware.

Here's a simplified example of how you might set up your server:

```ts
import Express from 'express';

const app = Express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to Stripe_lite!");
});

const createServer = () => {
    // Configure your server here
    // This could include setting up middleware, routing, etc.
};

const startServer = () => {
    const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
        console.log(`Server running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    })
};

startServer();
```

## Step 2: Configuring Your Project (`config.ts`)

The `config.ts` file will hold our environment-based or file-based configuration (e.g., database connection info, API keys, etc.).

One way you might set up your configuration file is outlined below:

```ts
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

export const config = {
  database: {
    name: process.env.DB_NAME,
    user: process.env.DB_USER,
    password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD,
  },
  stripe: {
    secretKey: process.env.STRIPE_SECRET,
    publicKey: process.env.STRIPE_PUBLIC,
  },
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
};
```

**Important**: Don't forget to include your `.env` file in your `.gitignore` file to avoid exposing sensitive information!

## Step 3: Managing Payments (`payments/payment_controller.ts` and `payments/payment_service.ts`)

We now need to focus our efforts on managing charges and refunds. The `payment_controller.ts` will define Express routes or handlers for payment actions, such as creating charges or processing refunds.

Here's a short example of how you might implement these concepts:

```ts
// payments/payment_controller.ts
import Express from 'express';
import paymentService from './payment_service';

const router = Express.Router();

router.post('/charge', async (req, res) => {
    const { customerId, amount, paymentMethod } = req.body;
    try {
        const response = await paymentService.createCharge(customerId, amount, paymentMethod);
        res.json(response);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(`Error creating charge: ${error}`);
    }
});

router.post('/refund', async (req, res) => {
    const { chargeId } = req.body;
    try {
        const response = await paymentService.refundCharge(chargeId);
        res.json(response);
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).send(`Error refunding charge: ${error}`);
    }
});

export default router;
```

In the `payment_service.ts`, you might implement the core functionality such as initiating the charges and processing refunds. This could literally interact with a payment gateway or just with records of transactions in the database as a simulation.

## Future Steps

Continue in a similar fashion for customers, subscriptions, webhooks, and dashboard directories. For routes, ensure to import them in `server.ts` to register them.

Lastly, don't forget to document your project thoroughly. Provide sample data whenever possible. For instance, a basic payments demo within an `examples` directory would be helpful for new users who want to integrate with `Stripe_lite`.

Remember, for the MVP, it doesn't have to be perfect. The goal is to make it work. As you go along, you can iterate and improve upon the project by adding more features, optimizing the existing ones, and enhancing your documentation. Good luck!
